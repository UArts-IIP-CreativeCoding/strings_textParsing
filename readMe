Parse the text, "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" by Beatrix Potter for the following words, counting their occurance. Then visualize the data in some interesting way. Go beyond a simple bar graph. You can find the text at http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/14838/pg14838.txt Note that the text has more in it, than the simple story. You don't want to be parsing the text outside of the story.
